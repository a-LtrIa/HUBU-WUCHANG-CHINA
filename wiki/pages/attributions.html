          <p>
            1) In 2024 February, the team carried out preliminary market research and popular science publicity in Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guizhou and Shandong. <br>
            2) In 2024 March, the team leader, He Yangyu, represented the team to participate in the Hubei Rural Planning Research Association.<br>
            3) In 2024 April, together with the other three iGEM teams of Hubei University, the team organized and participated in the Hubei Synthetic Biology Open Conference.<br>
            4) In 2024 May, the team participated in two speech contests, namely "Reading at Hubei University, Forging Ahead in a New Journey" and the "Hundred Students' Lecture Forum", and won two bronze medals. <br>
            5) In 2024 June, the team participated in the 2024 Wuhan Seed Industry Expo and held the Carnival of the Synthetic Biology Popular Science Month. <br>
            6) In 2024 July, at the beginning of the month, the team went to Suzhou to participate in the CCiC communication conference and at the end of the month, went to the Wuhu Rice Technology Courtyard in Hubei to conduct teaching support activities. <br>
            7) In 2024 August, the team went to Shenzhen to participate in the final of the Synthetic Biology Challenge. <br>
